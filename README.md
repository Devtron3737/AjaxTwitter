    * I expected a div, inserted input and ul tags.
    * Held an array of results
    * On "input" to the input tag, made ajax query, updated results.
    * Wrote renderResults method.
    * This built li and anchor tag.
    * Modified FollowToggle to take options; built even that.
    * Avoid underscore until the very end?
* TweetCompose
    * Decreasing counter of chars left (use input event).
    * AJAX submit (obviously)
