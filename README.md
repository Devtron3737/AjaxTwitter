* FollowToggle
    * just change partial, applies everywhere!
    * handleClick/render
    * initial-follow-state, user-id data attributes
* UsersSearch
    * I expected a div, inserted input and ul tags.
    * Held an array of results
    * On "input" to the input tag, made ajax query, updated results.
    * Wrote renderResults method.
    * This built li and anchor tag.
    * Modified FollowToggle to take options; built even that.
    * Avoid underscore until the very end?
